Build an advanced, high-conversion HERO BANNER section for the homepage of “Formora Nepal”.

This hero section must feel premium, modern, calm, and extremely trustworthy, similar to top global service platforms (Stripe, Apple, Linear), but adapted for Nepal’s audience.

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Frontend only (NO backend, NO API calls)
- Use Next.js App Router with TypeScript
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Use Framer Motion for animations
- All images must be referenced from the /public folder
- Keep code modular and readable
- Button/link actions should only navigate (no submission logic yet)

--------------------------------------------------
HERO SECTION GOALS
--------------------------------------------------

1. Instantly communicate trust and professionalism
2. Clearly explain what the platform does
3. Strongly guide the user to take action
4. Reduce fear and hesitation
5. Work perfectly on mobile and slow networks

--------------------------------------------------
CONTENT REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------------------------

Headline (large, bold, animated):
“One Platform. Every Form. Zero Stress.”

Subheading (calm, reassuring tone):
“Government, education, foreign, banking, and digital form services — handled accurately, securely, and fast by experts.”

Supporting micro-text (trust cue):
“Trusted by Nepalis nationwide • Privacy-first • Error-free assistance”

--------------------------------------------------
CALL-TO-ACTION (VERY IMPORTANT)
--------------------------------------------------

Primary CTA Button:
Text: “Start My Application”
- Visually dominant
- Uses primary brand color
- Rounded, premium look
- Subtle pulse or glow animation to attract attention
- Navigates to /services (routing only)

Secondary CTA (less dominant):
Text: “Explore Services”
- Outline or secondary style
- Navigates to /services

Psychology:
- Primary CTA must clearly suggest progress and relief
- Wording should feel safe, not aggressive

--------------------------------------------------
ANIMATION REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------------------------

Use Framer Motion to implement:

1. Page load animation:
- Headline fades in + slides up
- Subheading appears slightly after (staggered animation)

2. Background motion:
- Soft animated gradient OR
- Floating abstract shapes/icons (documents, forms, checkmarks)

3. CTA animation:
- Subtle hover scale
- Gentle pulse or glow every few seconds (not distracting)

Animations must be:
- Smooth
- Purposeful
- Not flashy
- Not overwhelming

--------------------------------------------------
LAYOUT & DESIGN
--------------------------------------------------

Layout:
- Full-width hero
- Centered content on desktop
- Stacked content on mobile
- Generous white space

Background:
- Light gradient inspired by Nepal (soft red/neutral tones)
- Optional abstract illustration from /public (documents/forms theme)

Typography:
- Large readable headline
- Clear hierarchy
- Accessible contrast

--------------------------------------------------
MOBILE-FIRST REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------------------------

- Buttons must be thumb-friendly
- Text must wrap cleanly
- No overflow or animation glitches
- Performance optimized

--------------------------------------------------
DO NOT INCLUDE
--------------------------------------------------

- No form inputs
- No API calls
- No backend logic
- No analytics
- No hard-coded business data

--------------------------------------------------
FINAL EXPECTATION
--------------------------------------------------

The hero banner should feel like it was designed by a senior UI/UX team with deep understanding of:
- Trust psychology
- Conversion optimization
- Modern animation standards
- Nepal’s digital user base

Deliver clean, production-ready React components with clear structure and comments where necessary.
